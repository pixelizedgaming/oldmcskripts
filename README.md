# About
## What in tarnation is this?
These are a collection of old Skripts that I wrote for my Minehut servers during 2019-2020. During that time, Minehut only allowed Skript for any sort of custom plugins, which meant that any developers had to pick up an entirely new language to modify ingame behavior.
## Why are you sharing this?
I guess I just feel kind of nostalgic for the times I actually felt motivated to program something cool. Also, hopefully others can learn from my spaghetti as things you should not be doing.
## How long did these take you?
PixelizedGens took me about a week to make, and I wrote a few bugfixes in the couple weeks after that. The minehut server that the code ran on was on the top row of minehut for its running time, but I had to take it down as midterms approached and my deteriorating mental health was going to leave the server without any developers (I was project lead and developer for the server, couldn't find another reliable developer in time)
Exclave was a scrapped rpg test that I was planning on making, I sort of just gave up on it after I started working on PixelizedGens (especially with how exhausted I was after working on that)
## Why did you feel the need to use bubblesort for your leaderboard code?
Don't ask. Literally just looked up "sorting algorithms" on google and implemented the first one I saw. Big lesson for me.
# How to install
look up "minecraft spigot server tutorial" on youtube and then get skript, skrayfall, skdragon, Morkazsk, SkNbeet, skellett, sklib, tablisknu, Tuske, copy the skripts into your skripts folder
sorry for the lackluster explanation, really forgot how to do most of this
